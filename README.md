# üöö AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

### üìä End-to-End Data Analytics Project | Power BI | MySQL | Excel | FMCG Domain

---

## üß© Project Overview

**Objective:**
AtliQ Mart, a fast-growing FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, is facing **supply chain inefficiencies** that led to **contract non-renewals by key customers**.
The company suspects late or incomplete deliveries as the root cause and wants to track delivery performance metrics like **On Time (OT%)**, **In Full (IF%)**, and **On Time In Full (OTIF%)** to identify service-level gaps and improve customer satisfaction before expanding into Tier 1 cities.

**Goal:**
Develop a **data-driven dashboard** to:

* Track daily customer service levels across all cities.
* Analyze **delivery performance vs. target**.
* Generate actionable insights to improve **supply chain reliability**.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

> ‚ÄúHow efficiently is AtliQ Mart managing its supply chain ‚Äî are orders being delivered on time, in full, and as per customer expectations?‚Äù

The key challenge is to measure and monitor:

* **Delivery punctuality (On Time %)**
* **Delivery completeness (In Full %)**
* **Combined reliability (OTIF %)**

...and use this data to identify which customers, cities, or products cause the most issues.
